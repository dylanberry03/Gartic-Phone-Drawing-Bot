# Gartic-Phone-Drawing-Bot
A very simple python Gartic Phone drawing bot that auto draws from a screenshot.

Keep in mind I am not a coding type person and my code might not work for you but it does for me
I just open Visual Studio Code on my laptop
I have python installed on it
I load the code and it works

Firstly Run all boxes above the giant thing of code (They are very short and say install)
Then the giant amount of code box click run
Go back to your search browser and search for the image you want
click images
click on the image you want
Tap your 'W' key to start
put cursor on top left of image then click your 'O' Key
put cursor on bottom right of image then click your 'N' Key

go back to your gartic phone game when you have the drawing turn
tap your 'K' key to start drawing (Try not to move your mouse around)

for second drawings and on you repeat the same steps but you do not have to run the code again
you will go to the image same as before but this time you will not have to tap 'W'
you will have to position cursor and tap 'O' and so on

my computer has certain dimensions so if it is not the same as mine it will not work, however the code is easy to edit. there will be commented lines near values you may have to change.
