# Gartic-Phone-Drawing-Bot
A very simple python Gartic Phone drawing bot that auto draws from a screenshot.
My computer is 1920x1080 SO IF YOURS IS DIFFERENT YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT THE CODE. I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO EDIT IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE

Keep in mind I am not a coding type person and my code might not work for you but it does for me
I just open Visual Studio Code on my laptop
I have python installed on it
I load the code and it works

Firstly Run all boxes above the giant thing of code (They are very short and say install)
Then the giant amount of code box click run
Go back to your search browser and search for the image you want
click images
click on the image you want
Tap your 'M' key to start
put cursor on top left of image then click your 'O' Key
put cursor on bottom right of image then click your 'N' Key

go back to your gartic phone game when you have the drawing turn
tap your 'K' key to start drawing (Try not to move your mouse around)

for second drawings and on you repeat the same steps but you do not have to run the code again
you will go to the image same as before but this time you will not have to tap 'M'
you will have to position cursor and tap 'O' and so on


HOW TO EDIT INCASE YOUR SCREEN DIMENSIONS ARE DIFFERENT
*YOU WONT HAVE TO CHANGE COORDS IF YOUR SCREEN SIZE IS 1920x1080*
my computer has certain dimensions so if it is not the same as mine it will not work as is, however the code is easy to edit. there will be commented lines near values you may have to change.

open Visual Studio Code
open my code provided
everything with comments (should be in green) are values you will need to change
it can be tedious but it shouldn't take a long time

At the end of the entire code there will be a block of code about finding position of cursor
when you need to find the position of something to change the position set in code is when you will use this

For example,
to find the coords of the top left of the gartic phone canvas

1. run the bottom code to find position
2. go to gartic phone
3. place cursor on top left of area you can draw in
4. tap your 'K' key
5. go back to Visual Studio Code and copy the coords printed
6. change the value of the coords for the gartic phone canvas top left

will have to change for all
